# WebSocket Audio Streaming Implementation

## Overview
Successfully implemented real-time WebSocket audio streaming from client to server, allowing the client to record and stream audio data continuously to the server, which saves it to files.

## Implementation Details

### Server Side (`main.py`)
- **WebSocket Endpoint**: `/ws`
- **Functionality**: 
  - Accepts WebSocket connections
  - Receives binary audio data chunks in real-time
  - Handles control messages (`START_RECORDING`, `STOP_RECORDING`)
  - Saves audio data to `.webm` files in the `uploads/` directory
  - Provides session management with unique filenames

### Client Side (`websocket_audio.html`)
- **Modern HTML5/JavaScript interface**
- **Features**:
  - WebSocket connection management
  - Real-time microphone access using MediaRecorder API
  - Configurable chunk streaming interval (default: 250ms)
  - Visual feedback with connection status indicators
  - Recording timer with real-time updates
  - Comprehensive logging of all WebSocket activity

## Key Technical Features

### Audio Streaming
- Uses MediaRecorder API to capture audio in real-time
- Streams audio chunks via WebSocket at regular intervals
- Supports multiple audio formats (WebM/Opus)
- No local accumulation - streams directly to server

### Server Processing
- Handles binary WebSocket messages for audio data
- Processes text messages for control signals
- Robust error handling with connection recovery
- Automatic file saving on recording stop or disconnection

### Session Management
- Unique session IDs for each recording
- Timestamped filenames: `websocket_recording_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS_sessionid.webm`
- Multiple recording sessions supported in single connection

## File Structure
```
├── main.py                          # FastAPI server with WebSocket endpoint
├── static/
│   └── websocket_audio.html         # Client interface for audio streaming
├── uploads/                         # Directory where audio files are saved
└── simple_ws_test.py               # Simple test script for WebSocket functionality
```

## Usage Instructions

### Start Server
```bash
uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

### Access Client Interface
Open in browser: `http://localhost:8000/static/websocket_audio.html`

### Testing Steps
1. Click "Connect" to establish WebSocket connection
2. Click "Start Recording" to begin audio streaming  
3. Speak into microphone (audio streams in real-time)
4. Click "Stop Recording" to save audio file
5. Check `uploads/` directory for saved files

## WebSocket Protocol

### Messages from Client to Server
- **Binary Data**: Raw audio chunks from MediaRecorder
- **Text Messages**:
  - `START_RECORDING`: Initialize new recording session
  - `STOP_RECORDING`: Finalize and save current recording
  - Other text: Echoed back by server

### Messages from Server to Client  
- **Connection**: Session ID and ready status
- **Acknowledgments**: Confirmation of received audio chunks
- **Status Updates**: Recording start/stop confirmations
- **File Info**: Saved file details (name, size, chunk count)

## Technical Specifications

### Audio Settings
- **Format**: WebM with Opus codec
- **Sample Rate**: 44.1kHz  
- **Processing**: Echo cancellation, noise suppression, auto-gain control
- **Chunk Interval**: 250ms (configurable)

### File Output
- **Location**: `uploads/websocket_recording_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS_SESSIONID.webm`
- **Format**: WebM container with Opus audio codec
- **Playable**: Compatible with modern browsers and media players

## Error Handling
- Graceful WebSocket disconnection handling
- Automatic file saving on unexpected disconnects
- Microphone permission error handling
- Connection recovery support
- Comprehensive logging for debugging

## Breaking Change Note
⚠️ **This implementation intentionally breaks the existing UI** as requested. The original recording logic that accumulated chunks locally has been replaced with real-time streaming to the server via WebSockets.

## Verification
- Server logs show real-time audio chunk reception
- Files are created in `uploads/` directory with correct timestamps
- WebSocket connection status is clearly indicated in browser
- Audio data is successfully saved to playable `.webm` files

## Success Metrics
✅ Audio data streams from client to server via WebSocket  
✅ Binary audio chunks received and processed by server  
✅ Audio files successfully saved to server filesystem  
✅ Session management with unique identifiers working  
✅ Real-time feedback and status updates functioning  
✅ Error handling and graceful disconnection implemented
